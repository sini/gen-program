# THE STANDALONE ENTRY'S OWN DEFAULTS — the cells no other cell in this repository can be.
#
# Every other cell here takes `genProgram` from `ci/flake.nix`, which builds it with `import ../lib`
# from ci's own flake INPUTS, so the root shim is never evaluated and its `ci/flake.lock`-backed
# defaults are never forced. That is precisely where this library's non-flake contract lives:
# `import ./. { }` must produce the same library the flake path does, resolving every dependency
# from `./ci/flake.lock` with no argument supplied and no search path consulted.
#
# ★★ THE CALL IS ARITY-DISPATCHED, NOT `import ../.. { }`. A dependency-free library publishes its
# root as a bare VALUE rather than a function, so the literal application is wrong at those roots by
# design; `if builtins.isFunction v then v { } else v` is the one form total over the roster, and it
# is the same construct the shim's own `dep` uses. Writing the literal here would make these cells
# assert a call convention the ecosystem deliberately does not have.
#
# ★★★ THREE CELLS, ONE ORACLE, AND THE FIRST TWO ARE HERMETIC. The obligation is per DEPENDENCY
# PATH, not per library: a cell that reds when ANY ONE dependency is unreachable measures a
# disjunction while reading like a conjunction, and a previous cell here certified this library at 0
# of its 2 paths while green. The three below split the claim so nothing carries a coverage figure
# only a comment states:
#   1. `…-defaults-to-its-own-node` — every WIRED dependency resolves to a node of ITS OWN
#      repository. `expr` and `expected` are both `mapAttrs` over the shim's own formal-to-path map,
#      so the domain is whatever the root wires and never a hand-written list.
#   2. `…-is-the-libs-own-formals` — the DENOMINATOR, taken independently of that map, so an empty
#      map cannot read as a pass.
#   3. `…-forces-every-dependency` — the FORCING half, and the only non-hermetic cell in this file.
#
# ★★ AND FOUR CELLS BELOW THEM, CLOSING THREE INVARIANTS THE THREE ABOVE REST ON, EACH OF WHICH READ
# FULLY GREEN ON A TREE CARRYING ITS OWN DEFECT AT ALL FOUR TRANCHE-1 LIBRARIES before they existed:
# the shim's `wire` default (with its control), the `follows` walk — declared ONCE, in `default.nix`,
# and READ here rather than transcribed, so the control over a hermetic fixture lock is the whole
# oracle for that rule — and channel 2 of the shim's three, the `inputs` override bag.
#
# ★★ THE DOMAIN IS THE WIRED SET, NOT THE DECLARED SET — AND IT IS THE `deps` HALF OF THE RECORD
# THE SHIM'S BODY HANDS TO `wire`, NOT THE ATTRSET `./lib` RECEIVES. The two coincide only while
# `wire`'s own default is `{ deps, resolve, lock }: import ./lib deps`, which is a property of ONE LINE OF
# TEXT and is held by `…-the-wire-default-is-the-librarys-own-application` below and by nothing else.
# `paths` reads the `deps` handed to `wire`, so a formal that is declared and never threaded into it
# is invisible to every cell over it. That is a domain statement rather than a gap — the shim's
# declared formals are read by the DENOMINATOR cell against `../../lib`'s own, which is where a stray
# formal surfaces.
#
# ★★★ THE THIRD CELL IS NOT HERMETIC, AND THAT IS ITS WHOLE POINT. Forcing the defaults IS
# `builtins.fetchTree`, so it reaches the network — the accepted price of measuring the thing at all,
# and the reason it sits apart from the suites that must not. It remains PURE: `fetchTree` on a
# locked node is narHash-addressed, with no channel and no `<…>`.
#
# ★★ AND IT NEEDS NO WORKLOAD, WHICH IS THE WHOLE OF WHAT THE SHIM'S EAGER BODY BUYS. Every member
# this library publishes is either a lambda or a value independent of the substrate, and neither
# `builtins.deepSeq` nor a per-member force enters a lambda — so a force of the SURFACE reaches
# nothing, and the cell that stood here had to CALL the library over a fixture to reach the resolver
# at all. The shim now forces its dependencies at the boundary, so a WHNF force of the root reaches
# every one of them whatever the surface's shape. Driven per path, seal one and resolve the rest:
# landed body 0 of 2, eager body 2 of 2.
{ genProgram, ... }:
let
  entry = import ../..;
  dispatched = if builtins.isFunction entry then entry { } else entry;

  # ★★ THE SEAM-CLOSING ARGUMENT SET, BOUND RATHER THAN WRITTEN AT THE APPLICATION. `dep` stops the
  # resolver at the path instead of fetching it, and replacing `wire` publishes the whole record the
  # body hands TO `wire` — whose `deps` half is the attrset `./lib` receives only while `wire`'s own
  # default is `{ deps, resolve, lock }: import ./lib deps`, a text property the cell at the foot of this
  # file is what holds, and whose `resolve` half is the shim's own `follows` rule, which is why
  # nothing below transcribes that rule. So this application is hermetic by CONSTRUCTION and not by
  # luck. It is bound because an argument set written as a literal at `import ../..` is the
  # bare-application shape this domain's structural cells refuse.
  pathArgs = {
    dep = segs: segs;
    wire = args: args;
  };
  seam = import ../.. pathArgs;
  paths = seam.deps;

  # ★★★ THE SHIM'S OWN RESOLVER, READ RATHER THAN RETRANSCRIBED. `default.nix` holds the ONE
  # declaration of the `follows` rule in this library and publishes it in the record its body hands
  # to `wire`; this is that binding and not a copy of it. So the fixture control below drives the
  # expression the shim itself resolves with, and `…-defaults-to-its-own-node` resolves the shim's
  # declared paths by the shim's own rule rather than by a second copy that can agree with its own
  # expectation while both are wrong.
  shimResolve = seam.resolve;

  # ★ THE ROOT LOCK, READ AS PURE DATA — and the rule that walks it is NO LONGER TRANSCRIBED HERE:
  # `shimResolve` above IS `default.nix`'s binding. A direct edge IS the node key; a `follows` value
  # is a PATH resolved segment by segment from this lock's own root. Never `lock.nodes.<label>` — a
  # last-segment shortcut reads a DIFFERENT node, and a ci lock routinely carries several same-named
  # ones. Reading the lock is pure data; nothing here fetches.
  lock = seam.lock;

  # ★★ THE RESOLVER IS BOUND OVER ITS LOCK, AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES ITS CONTROL EXPRESSIBLE AT ALL. A
  # `repoOf` closed over THIS lock has no free parameter, so a control could only re-assert the main
  # arm's own value; taking the lock as an argument is what puts the control AT AN INPUT THE MAIN ARM
  # DOES NOT USE. `shimResolve` takes its lock the same way and for the same reason — which is why
  # `default.nix` publishes the LOCK-PARAMETERISED rule rather than its own applied `fetch`. The
  # `lock` formal here deliberately shadows the binding above.
  #
  # ★★★ AND THE CONTROL IS NOT CEREMONY, IT IS THE ENTIRE ORACLE FOR THIS RULE — which this library
  # declares EXACTLY ONCE, in `default.nix`, so *this rule* now names one expression and not two.
  # MEASURED at the four tranche-1 libraries while the cell still carried a second copy of the fold:
  # with the SHIM's fold replaced by the `lock.nodes.<last segment>` shortcut its own comment
  # forbids, the entry suite read FULLY GREEN at all four. 3 of their 13 wired paths resolve to a
  # DIFFERENT NODE under that shortcut and two of those at a different REVISION — but `locked.repo`
  # is identical under both rules at all 13, so `…-defaults-to-its-own-node` cannot discriminate a
  # resolver on this library's real lock at all. A hermetic fixture is the only thing that can, and
  # it now drives the SHIM's binding: with that same shortcut written into `default.nix`'s `resolve`,
  # the control below reds — rc 1, and exactly one failing cell, at all four tranche-1 libraries.
  repoOf = lock: segs: lock.nodes.${shimResolve lock segs}.locked.repo;

  # ★ THE FIXTURE LOCK, AND IT IS TWO CLAIMS IN ONE SHAPE. `root → a` is a DIRECT edge, where the
  # value IS the node key; `a-node → b` is a `follows` PATH resolved from the lock's own root — so
  # both branches of `following` are exercised. Walking `[ "a" "b" ]` lands on `the-walked-node`;
  # indexing the last segment lands on the unrelated node keyed `b`. The two rules disagree BY
  # CONSTRUCTION, which is what makes the control total over every library rather than over the ones
  # whose own lock happens to disagree. It is a literal: nothing here reads a file or fetches.

  #

  # ★★★ THE SHIM'S OWN `wire` DEFAULT, AND IT IS WHAT EVERY HERMETIC CELL ABOVE RESTS ON. `paths` is

  # ★★★ CHANNEL 2 — THE `inputs` OVERRIDE BAG. The shim declares three channels and one precedence:
  # a named formal wins, the bag is next, tested by attrset membership, and the ci lock is the
  # default. Every cell above exercises the LOCK, so a formal transcribed as `x ? dep [ … ]` instead
  # of `x ? inputs.gen-x or (dep [ … ])` leaves its override silently ignored — MEASURED, both arms
  # in one run: on that one edit the supplied override is dropped and the whole entry suite reads
  # green. ★ It matters most where the flake arm is UNAPPLIED — the root published as `import ./.`
  # rather than applied — because there the bag is the ONLY override path a consumer has. At tranche
  # 1 that was three of the four.
  #
  # ★★ TOTAL OVER THE WIRED SET BY CONSTRUCTION. `expr` and `expected` are both derived from
  # `paths`, so the domain is whatever the root wires and never a hand-written list, and the
  # denominator is taken independently by `…-is-the-libs-own-formals`, so an empty map cannot read as
