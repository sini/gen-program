# THE STANDALONE ENTRY'S OWN DEFAULTS — the cells no other cell in this repository can be.
#
# Every other cell here takes `genProgram` from `ci/flake.nix`, which builds it with `import ../lib`
# from ci's own flake INPUTS, so the root shim is never evaluated and its `ci/flake.lock`-backed
# defaults are never forced. That is precisely where this library's non-flake contract lives:
# `import ./. { }` must produce the same library the flake path does, resolving every dependency
# from `./ci/flake.lock` with no argument supplied and no search path consulted.
#
# ★★ THE CALL IS ARITY-DISPATCHED, NOT `import ../.. { }`. A dependency-free library publishes its
# root as a bare VALUE rather than a function, so the literal application is wrong at those roots by
# design; `if builtins.isFunction v then v { } else v` is the one form total over the roster, and it
# is the same construct the shim's own `dep` uses. Writing the literal here would make these cells
# assert a call convention the ecosystem deliberately does not have.
#
# ★★★ THREE CELLS, ONE ORACLE, AND THE FIRST TWO ARE HERMETIC. The obligation is per DEPENDENCY
# PATH, not per library: a cell that reds when ANY ONE dependency is unreachable measures a
# disjunction while reading like a conjunction, and a previous cell here certified this library at 0
# of its 2 paths while green. The three below split the claim so nothing carries a coverage figure
# only a comment states:
#   1. `…-defaults-to-its-own-node` — every WIRED dependency resolves to a node of ITS OWN
#      repository. `expr` and `expected` are both `mapAttrs` over the shim's own formal-to-path map,
#      so the domain is whatever the root wires and never a hand-written list.
#   2. `…-is-the-libs-own-formals` — the DENOMINATOR, taken independently of that map, so an empty
#      map cannot read as a pass.
#   3. `…-forces-every-dependency` — the FORCING half, and the only non-hermetic cell in this file.
#
# ★★ AND FOUR CELLS BELOW THEM, ONE PER INVARIANT THE THREE ABOVE REST ON AND EACH OF WHICH READ
# FULLY GREEN ON A TREE CARRYING ITS OWN DEFECT before they existed: the shim's `wire` default (with
# its control), the `follows` walk this file transcribes (a control over a hermetic fixture lock, and
# the whole oracle for that rule), and channel 2 of the shim's three, the `inputs` override bag.
#
# ★★ THE DOMAIN IS THE WIRED SET, NOT THE DECLARED SET — AND IT IS THE ATTRSET THE SHIM'S BODY
# HANDS TO `wire`, NOT THE ONE `./lib` RECEIVES. The two coincide only while `wire`'s own default is
# `args: import ./lib args`, which is a property of ONE LINE OF TEXT and is held by
# `…-the-wire-default-is-the-librarys-own-application` below and by nothing else. `paths` reads the
# attrset handed to `wire`, so a formal that is declared and never threaded into it is invisible to
# every cell over it. That is a domain statement rather than a gap — the shim's declared formals are
# read by the DENOMINATOR cell against `../../lib`'s own, which is where a stray formal surfaces.
#
# ★★★ THE THIRD CELL IS NOT HERMETIC, AND THAT IS ITS WHOLE POINT. Forcing the defaults IS
# `builtins.fetchTree`, so it reaches the network — the accepted price of measuring the thing at all,
# and the reason it sits apart from the suites that must not. It remains PURE: `fetchTree` on a
# locked node is narHash-addressed, with no channel and no `<…>`.
#
# ★★ AND IT NEEDS NO WORKLOAD, WHICH IS THE WHOLE OF WHAT THE SHIM'S EAGER BODY BUYS. Every member
# this library publishes is either a lambda or a value independent of the substrate, and neither
# `builtins.deepSeq` nor a per-member force enters a lambda — so a force of the SURFACE reaches
# nothing, and the cell that stood here had to CALL the library over a fixture to reach the resolver
# at all. The shim now forces its dependencies at the boundary, so a WHNF force of the root reaches
# every one of them whatever the surface's shape. Driven per path, seal one and resolve the rest:
# landed body 0 of 2, eager body 2 of 2.
{ genProgram, ... }:
let
  entry = import ../..;
  dispatched = if builtins.isFunction entry then entry { } else entry;

  # ★★ THE SEAM-CLOSING ARGUMENT SET, BOUND RATHER THAN WRITTEN AT THE APPLICATION. `dep` stops the
  # resolver at the path instead of fetching it, and replacing `wire` publishes the attrset the
  # body hands TO `wire` — which is the attrset `./lib` receives only while `wire`'s own default is
  # `args: import ./lib args`, a text property the cell at the foot of this file is what holds. So
  # this application is hermetic by CONSTRUCTION and not by luck. It is bound because an argument set
  # written as a literal at `import ../..` is the bare-application shape this domain's structural
  # cells refuse.
  pathArgs = {
    dep = segs: segs;

  paths = import ../.. pathArgs;

  # ★ THE SHIM'S OWN `following` RULE, TRANSCRIBED. A direct edge IS the node key; a `follows` value
  # is a PATH resolved segment by segment from this lock's own root. Never `lock.nodes.<label>` — a
  # last-segment shortcut reads a DIFFERENT node, and a ci lock routinely carries several same-named
  # ones. Reading the lock is pure data; nothing here fetches.
  lock = builtins.fromJSON (builtins.readFile ../flake.lock);

  # ★★ THE RESOLVER IS BOUND OVER ITS LOCK, AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES ITS CONTROL EXPRESSIBLE AT ALL. A
  # `repoOf` closed over THIS lock has no free parameter, so a control could only re-assert the main
  # arm's own value; taking the lock as an argument is what puts the control AT AN INPUT THE MAIN ARM
  # DOES NOT USE. The `lock` formal deliberately shadows the binding above — inside here the lock is
  # whatever this application was handed, which is the whole of the point.
  #
  # ★★★ AND THE CONTROL IS NOT CEREMONY, IT IS THE ENTIRE ORACLE FOR THIS RULE. MEASURED: with the
  # fold below replaced by the `lock.nodes.<last segment>` shortcut the comment above forbids, the
  # entry suite read FULLY GREEN at all four tranche-1 libraries. 3 of their 13 wired paths resolve
  # to a DIFFERENT NODE under that shortcut and two of those at a different REVISION — but
  # `locked.repo` is identical under both rules at all 13, so `…-defaults-to-its-own-node` cannot
  # discriminate its own resolver anywhere, and at a library whose every path agrees under both rules
  # no plant could red it even in principle. A hermetic fixture is the only thing that can.

  # ★ THE FIXTURE LOCK, AND IT IS TWO CLAIMS IN ONE SHAPE. `root → a` is a DIRECT edge, where the
  # value IS the node key; `a-node → b` is a `follows` PATH resolved from the lock's own root — so
  # both branches of `following` are exercised. Walking `[ "a" "b" ]` lands on `the-walked-node`;
  # indexing the last segment lands on the unrelated node keyed `b`. The two rules disagree BY
  # CONSTRUCTION, which is what makes the control total over every library rather than over the ones
  # whose own lock happens to disagree. It is a literal: nothing here reads a file or fetches.

  #
  # ★ STATED CEILING: `locked.repo` is neither `owner` nor node identity. A same-named repository
  # under another owner passes, and so does a path repointed at a DIFFERENT NODE of the right

  # nonexistent node, an unresolvable follows path or a throwing root at the BOUNDARY, on every path,
  # rather than wherever a consumer first happens to reach one.
  #
  # ★ THE FORCE STOPS AT WHNF, DELIBERATELY: `seq` of an attrset does not force its members, so this

  # ★★★ THE SHIM'S OWN `wire` DEFAULT, AND IT IS WHAT EVERY HERMETIC CELL ABOVE RESTS ON. `paths` is
  # the attrset the shim's body hands to `wire` — it is the attrset `./lib` RECEIVES only while
  # `wire`'s own default is `args: import ./lib args`, and no cell above reads that default: the two
  # hermetic cells REPLACE `wire` with `args: args`, the forcing cell stops at WHNF of whatever
  # `wire` returned, and the surface cell compares `attrNames`, which `./lib`'s structure fixes
  # independently of its arguments. MEASURED, both arms in one run: with the default replaced by

  #
  # ★★ THE READING IS IRREDUCIBLY TEXTUAL, AND THAT IS THE SEAM'S OWN REASON FOR EXISTING: Nix

  # default at all; `rewired` proves it refuses the one-token corruption the main arm exists to
  # catch; `commented` proves the comment strip is LIVE, and that arm is the sharp one — the same

  # ★★★ CHANNEL 2 — THE `inputs` OVERRIDE BAG. The shim declares three channels and one precedence:
  # a named formal wins, the bag is next, tested by attrset membership, and the ci lock is the
  # default. Every cell above exercises the LOCK, so a formal transcribed as `x ? dep [ … ]` instead
  # of `x ? inputs.gen-x or (dep [ … ])` leaves its override silently ignored — MEASURED, both arms
  # in one run: on that one edit the supplied override is dropped and the whole entry suite reads
  # green. ★ It is the channel that matters most where the flake arm is UNAPPLIED, which is three of
  # the four libraries carrying this file: there the bag is the ONLY override path a consumer has.
  #
  # ★★ TOTAL OVER THE WIRED SET BY CONSTRUCTION. `expr` and `expected` are both derived from
  # `paths`, so the domain is whatever the root wires and never a hand-written list, and the
  # denominator is taken independently by `…-is-the-libs-own-formals`, so an empty map cannot read as
  # a pass. The sentinels are DISTINCT per formal, so a bag key wired to the wrong formal reds too.
