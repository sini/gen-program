# Standalone (non-flake) entry. Flake consumers should use the `.lib` output.
#
# gen-program declares NO INPUTS, and that is a decision the content makes rather than one the
# scaffold made on its behalf: it takes its substrate — the utility base and the evaluator that
# owns the semantics — as INJECTED VALUES constructed inside the consumer's own evaluation, which
# is what the gen↔gen boundary rule asks for. So there is nothing here to fetch and nothing to
# pin, and this entry is the library value itself: a function of the substrate the caller supplies.
#
# A consequence, not an omission: zero inputs means no root lock file. The only lock in this
# repository is ./ci/flake.lock, and it is what the acceptance run uses.
